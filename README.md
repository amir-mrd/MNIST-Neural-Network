# MNIST-Neural-Network

### Classification using a Simple Neural Network on MNIST Dataset.

In this example, we will use the TensorFlow library to create a simple neural network-based classification model for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9) and is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.
